## âš¡ CUDA Acceleration (Optional)

If you'd like to leverage **CUDA** to accelerate computations:

1. Download and install the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
2. Ensure that the `$CUDA_PATH` environment variable is properly set.
3. Then, run the following commands to complete the setup:

```bash
   pip install nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12
   pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
```

You may need restart your computer to enable all cuda features.
